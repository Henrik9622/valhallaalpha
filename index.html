    <p  >ValhallaStudios was established as Nordic Games Licensing within Nordic Games Group in 2011. The latter had previously purchased assets from the bankrupt publisher JoWooD and established Nordic Games GmbH a subsidiary of Nordic Games Licensing to manage them. Nordic Games Licensing continued to purchase intellectual property from defunct publishers, notably several THQ products in 2013, followed by the "THQ" trademark in 2014. In August 2016, Nordic Games Licensing and Nordic Games GmbH changed their names to THQ Nordic. The parent company became a public company in 2016 and was renamed Embracer Group in 2019. Until 2023, Embracer Group rapidly grew through major acquisitions and investments. After a US$2 billion investment unexpectedly fell through, the company was more than $2 billion in debt and began closing and selling multiple studios and while laying off people at others.</p>
